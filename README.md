# Restaurant Page

This is a home page for a fake coffee shop named Just Simple Cafe. The site 
is my first project utilizing NPM and webpack, and utilizes DOM manipulator 
to make it a single page "app". As such, when flipping between Home, Menu,
and contact, the content should load pretty fast as it won't need to refresh
the entire page.
